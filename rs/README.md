# Chain Selectors (Rust)

This folder contains the Rust implementation of the Chain Selectors module.

## Pre-requisites

As part of the code generation, `rustfmt` is used to format the generated code. If you don't have rust toolchain installed, it will run in docker.

## Build

To build the Chain Selectors module, run the `go generate ./rs` from the root of the project.
